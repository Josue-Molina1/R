# Overview

Hello World, 
Welcome to my R repository, as a good fan of SQL I'm trying to deepen my knowledge on Data Analysis, I hope you can find anything helpful on my efforts to understand R and have fun while doing it. 

The software on this repository is meant to analize my Spotify account most played songs, which are my favourite artist and so on, just so you can know what I listen to while coding.

Want to see the code I wrote, take a look! R was challenging, I would love to try it again with R studio rather than VS Code.

# Development Environment

I ended up using VS Code for this R project, mostly because I'm very familiar with it now, setting up for VS Code might not sound challenging, but there are so many other things that need to be installed and plotting data seems to work differen-
tly, as I said before I would love to use R Studio next time! 

Some of the libraries I used on this piece of software were: tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse, although some of them were not 
what I was looking for at the beggining.

# Future Work

Some things I'm still working on are:

- Plotting and displaying data on the screen so the users can have a better understanding not by text only,
but by visualization. 
- Adding a CSV with current information about the user data. 
- Make it so the user can search for different information with simple queries. 
- Build a better interface.
